# Learning Summary

This project helped me understand:

- How AWS routes traffic between subnets and VPCs.
- How route tables and associations impact connectivity.
- How Security Groups and Network ACLs affect allowed/blocked traffic.
- How to reason about traffic flow and troubleshoot connectivity issues.

This is part of my Cloud / DevOps / DevSecOps learning journey, focusing on AWS networking and connectivity fundamentals.
